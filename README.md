## Purpose of the application

The main goal of our app was to create a platform that connects local micro-enterprises and local manufacturers with clients directly.

## Other benefits

Our application can help directly influence the development of micro-enterprises and clients to overcome the results of inflation. It also reduces pollution, because there is no need to transport goods which are in your area. 


Demo of the app is deployed here: https://skylade.github.io/pgs-hackaton/.
